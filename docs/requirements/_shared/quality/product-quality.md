# Product quality

> **Layer L3 — Quality.** Cross-cutting quality expectations. Functional specifications inherit these documents via `inherits_quality` unless they document an explicit override.

## Security presentation

- Error messages do not reveal whether an account exists when the functional specification requires ambiguity (for example login — FR-AUTH-001).
- Sensitive actions use confirmation dialogs when the functional specification requires them (for example session revoke — FR-AUTH-004).
- Permission denial copy is uniform: **`You do not have permission to perform this action.`** (see STD-ACC-001 in conventions).

## How to reference in a functional specification

```markdown
## Quality requirements

- Inherits `docs/requirements/_shared/quality/product-quality.md` (`NFR-QUAL-001`) and linked quality documents.
- Override only when this specification differs (export cap, viewport behavior, etc.).
```
